## Why does it exist?

A program is simply a sequence of instructions that a computer can execute to obtain a desired output. 
Classical programming is all about a human (or a bunch of them) writing down these instructions that the computer will follow. 

A neural network is also a program, but it is a program that is learned from data. The programer just specifies the architecture of the network and the learning algorithm, and the network learns to perfom the desired task from data.
