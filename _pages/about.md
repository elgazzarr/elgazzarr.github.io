My research focus is on generative modeling in life scineces. \\
I integrate tools from dynamical systems, variational inference, and deep learning to model and control biological systems at multiple scales.

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University, The Netherlands.
